Machine Learning in Action

This book sets out to introduce people to important machine learning algorithms.
Tools and applications using these algorithms are introduced to give the reader an
idea of how they are used in practice today. A wide selection of machine learning
books is available, which discuss the mathematics, but discuss little of how to program
the algorithms. This book aims to be a bridge from algorithms presented in matrix
form to an actual functioning program. With that in mind, please note that this book
is heavy on code and light on mathematics.
